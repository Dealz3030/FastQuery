RuntimeBroker.exe is a legitimate Windows process developed by Microsoft, specifically associated with Windows 10, with the version number 10.0.15063.0, and it acts as a broker for app permissions, ensuring that Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps comply with the security and privacy settings defined by the user. While the file itself is safe and typically located in the System32 directory, users may sometimes encounter high CPU or memory usage attributed to RuntimeBroker.exe, which can lead to performance issues; this is often due to poorly coded applications or insufficient system resources rather than the executable itself being malicious. However, it's important to note that malware can disguise itself with the same name, so it's advisable to monitor its behavior and use antivirus software to scan for any potential threats if suspicious activity is detected. Overall, when functioning correctly, RuntimeBroker.exe plays a crucial role in maintaining app security within the Windows environment.
